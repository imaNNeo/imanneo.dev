    content: |-
      I have been a Software Engineer for 10 years now. This includes 7 years of Mobile Application Development. It also has been 5 years since I started working with Flutter.
      
      Contributing to the Flutter community has been my passion. That is why I created the [fl_chart plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/fl_chart) (which has around 6k stars). I also have published the [Flutter 4 Fun blog](https://flutter4fun.com) to solve UI Challenges in the form of blog posts.
      
      My Android (Kotlin, Java) Development background includes working in businesses such as Maps and Navigation, Social Media, Shopping, Fin-Tech, and E-commerce.
